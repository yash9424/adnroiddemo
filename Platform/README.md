# Platform Samples

A collection of samples of different Android OS platform APIs.

> **Note:** the goal of these samples are to showcase certain functionality in isolation and they 
> might use simplified code. The project uses the
> [casa-android](https://github.com/google/casa-android) (intended only for demo projects).
> For best practices follow our documentation and check
> [Now In Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid)

Browse the samples inside each topic samples folder:

- [Accessibility](samples/accessibility)
- [Camera](samples/camera)
- [Connectivity](samples/connectivity)
- [Graphics](samples/graphics)
- [Location](samples/location)
- [Privacy](samples/privacy)
- [User-interface](samples/user-interface)
- More to come...

You can find a list of all the available samples [here](samples/README.md).

> ðŸš§ **Work-in-Progress:** we are working on brining more existing and new samples into this format.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the whole project in Android Studio.
3. Sync & Run `app` configuration

The app will open with the samples list screen that allows you to navigate throughout the different
categories and available samples.

> **Note:** the `app` module is required to bring together all the samples but it's not relevant
> for their functionality, you can simply ignore it. The wiring is done under the hood and an
> implementation detail not needed to understand any sample functionality.

### Deeplink to sample

To open a specific sample directly you can use one of the auto-generated configurations.

1. Build the project at least once
2. Open `Run Configuration` dropdown
3. Select sample name
4. Run

> **Tip:** use `âŒƒâŒ¥R` or `Alt+Shift+F10` shortcut to open the full list and launch the selected one.
